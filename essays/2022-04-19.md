<h2>Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details</h2>
<p>
The assignment two is a continuation of assignment one where, on top of the basic store structure (i.e. index, product display, and invoice pages) that I have already built for assignment one, I also needed to add at least the login and registration pages. After adding both the login and registration pages, the newly modified store in assignment two functions such that after the user makes a valid purchase on the product display page and click the 'submit' button, the user needs to either log in at the login page or register at the registration page before he or she can view his or her final invoice. At the same time, after an user successfully logs in or registers, the product inventories (i.e. quantity available of the purchased product(s)) will automatically update to the latest number(s). Other requirements of the assignment include that the entered user information in the login or registration page needs to be validated and that the purchase information needs to be kept in a query string and passed from the products display page to the login or registration page and eventually to the invoice page, since this is the only way to generate an invoice successfully.
