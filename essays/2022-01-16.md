Management Information Systems (MIS) is a critical field of study that has caught my eyes during the past few years. Especially in the age of information and technology during which massive amounts of data are becoming available, studying MIS certainly helps an employer make well-informed decisions for their businesses based on the analysis of compiled and organized data. This way, the employer can maximize profit with limited resources and lead the development of the company in the right track. Nearly all of the Fortune 500 companies and hegemons of each industry employ MIS in their day-to-day operations to ensure their business success, and realizing the importance of MIS, many companies tend to require job candidates to have academic or career backgrounds in the MIS field. On the other hand, some companies might not require and still prefer job seekers to have MIS experience. Therefore, by selecting MIS as one of my majors, I will become more advantageous in the competitive job market.
