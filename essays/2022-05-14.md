<h2>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards).</h2>
<p>
My system is a sports shop that focuses on selling three types of sports-related products, which are balls, equipment, and miscellaneous items.
</p>
<h2>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</h2>
<p>
At the time of submitting our assignment 3, we did not have any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented. Throughout the creation of our assignment 3, Kai and I ran into numerous problems (ex. shopping cart not displaying the right products and quantities, not being able to update or remove products from the cart, the invoice not printing out user's full name in the personalized thank-you message, and etc.), but we were able to solve these problems such that the store is now fully functional. Last night, we also ran into another problem of not being able to update inventory after hitting the "complete purchase" button, but after working together, Kai was able to identify and correct the errors in the package-lock file and move some parts of the server code in a more correct sequence such that we were able to eventually update the inventory after a purchase is complete. All the required features were implemented, except some of the features mentioned in the extra-credit section of the assignment 3 decription.
</p>
<h2>Describe what you are most proud of about your system.</h2>
<p>
What I am most proud of our system is that it is much more advanced in comparison to the system I created for assignment 1 and assignment 2. By being more advanced, our system for assignment 3 is almost close to an online store that people would use in their day-to-day lives. Another part that I am also proud of is to implement all the major requirements into our store while also eliminating as many problems as possible. 
</p>
<h2>Describe what you are least happy with your system.</h2>
<p>
What I am least happy with our system is that we could have improved the user interface better to make it more nice and pleasing, but due to the time restraint and the large amount of work that Kai and I had to perform for assignment 3 and other classes, we were not able to get to improve the user interface design. Also, I am least happy with the organization of the code, as there were too many lines of code and similar variable names that made it difficult for us to use these variables at their rightful places.
</p>
<h2>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</h2>
<p>
In assignment 2, the requirements were much less in comparison to the requirements in assignment 3, as we just needed to build from assignment 1 and implement a login, register, and update page in between the products display page and the invoice page such that the user has to log in, register, or update their information first before being able access the invoice. However, in assignment 3, we had to implement more advanced features that were challenging to do, and these advanced features came from individual requirements, extra credits, and partially from the major requirements. For example, we had to implement a shopping cart that utilized session such that the shopping cart allowed users to come back and forth between different pages to either add more new products to or remove some of the current products from the shopping cart. Some of the other advanced features that we implemented that did not exist in assignment 2 requirements were password encryption and using session to keep track of a user's login status and log the user out if the user is inactive for a certain amount of time.
</p>
<h2>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</h2>
<p>
Just like Kai, when I ran into a problem, I would also inspect the browser console and the Visual Studio Code terminal and see where exactly the errors were coming from. Then, I would look into the lines of code that contained these errors and thought of possible reasons that might have caused these errors. If I deem a reason as the most probable cause for these errors, then I would immediately start editing the specific lines of code containing these errors in a way that would attempt to address the reason that I thought was the cause for these errors. At the same time, Kai would also utilize the same process of solving problems as me to increase the efficiency of solving problems.
